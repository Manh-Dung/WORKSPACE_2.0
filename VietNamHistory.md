 @Qarmatian Warhorse  Everything is a based, man. A lot of information is missing, important information is left out and many of them is not truth from our sources, and some are straight up lies like propaganda, it's long if I can name them all. But here I go:

1. About the French colonism need to aid some information, after the French won the first colonism war, they forced Vietnam to pay a war flee, they stolen what ever they saw in Vietnam, they stolen a lot natural resources and taken away many of national treasures right from the king palage which is now in the French museum.

2. About how him explain communism spread to Vietnam is totally wrong, he did not tell who brought communist, make it sounds like the French bring communism ideology through French education to Vietnam which is untrue. The one who brought communism ideology to Vietnam is no other than Ho Chi Minh himself, but he did not learned and studied about communism in Vietnam, he got to know about communism when he was in France and studied more about it in Russian, then found the Vietnam communist Party with some other Vietnamese in China, then he brought back to Vietnam after 30 fliking years 1911-1941. It taken him 30 year just to brought communism idealogy back to Vietnam. In 1941, Vietnam was under the Japanese colonization after the French surrendered to the Japanese in 1940 then the French came back to reinvade Vietnam in 1945 the same year the Japanese left. 

2.1. The French education was very limited in Vietnam, just a few number of Vietnamese people got a chance to go to school under French colonism and very very small few that could speak French language, not even a chance for the communism book brought to Vietnam through these French schools. 

2.2. Ho Chi Minh went to French school in Vietnam when he was young, but he got kicked out of the school because he make a anti-colonism speak against the French in Vietnam that they don't like it. Even so, he was taught by very basic words and basic phrases from the French language, he was unable to speak French fluently, not until he came to France, then he came to speak French fluently. 

2.3. He have no money, so he went to France by asking the French cruise ship captain in Saigon Vietnam to let him work as a waiter on the French cruise ship which he hired him to, he left Vietnam in 1911 on the French cruise ship and landed his foot on France in a month later. There, he do what ever job he can do in France for money, then he became fluent in French in 2 years. He then wrote many stories to the French newspaper about Vietnamese people are suffering under the French colonism in Vietnam to let the French people in France know the dirty things the French are doing in Vietnam which got read by the French officials and they wanted to capture him. He then escaped to the US in 1913. During his 1st year in France, he read a book from Vladimir Lenin the communist leader from Russia, he cried to it and he wanted to meet Vladimir Lenin. 

2.4. In the US in 1912-1913, he sent some letters asked the US government to help him with the French colonism to free Vietnam and give us independent, but the US favored the French more, they don't care about some poor Vietnamese. So he left the US and traveled to multiple different countries in South America and Europe for 10 years.

2.5. He came to Russia in 1923, he wanted to meet with Vladimir Lenin, but Lenin is already dead, He then spent a year study about communism in Russia, then he left to other countries.

2.6. The he wondered through Thailand, Indonexia, Malaysia, Sinapore, he was almost captured by the Singapore police, then he came to Guangzhou China in 1923-1927. But in Guangzhou China, the Chinese officials thought he is a Japanese spy, so they imprisoned him for a year then released him, then he went back to Russia to learn more about communism, then he back to Guangzhou China and met up with many Vietnamese there up to thousands of Vietnamese people in Guangzhou who willing to support him in China, then in 1930, he found the Vietnam communism party there.

2.7. Then he spent 11 years in China and back to Russia to prepare and to build up an army, he also got supported and funded by Bảo Đại the last emperor of Vietnam and his wife Queen Nam Phương who spent 3 years working with him and selling their property in France to fund money to support him. Bảo Đại was a puppet Vietnamese emperor of the French, but in the same time he supported Ho Chi Minh, he then later resigned in 1945 after the Japanese was defeated, he abdicated himself from being a king and given all his power to Hồ Chí Minh. (Griffin Johnson did mentioned about emperor Bảo Đại was a puppet of the French, but he failed to mentioned that he was secretly working behind the French's back to support Hồ Chí Minh in 3 years and given all his power in Vietnam to him after the Japanese lost)

2.8. Not until 1941, Ho Chi Minh came back to Vietnam and fought against the Japanese. The US was in a war against the Japanese in WWII so they funded Ho Chi Minh communist army the "Việt Minh" and selected Ho Chi Minh as their primary contact. The US aid the Việt Minh with weapons, training and money. The Russia and China were given giving zero F to Ho Chi Minh back then. He then defeated the Japanese in Vietnam before Japan surrender to the US, many Japanese soldiers up to 1000, rejoined the Việt Minh and fought the French later. From there, communism ideology spreaded wildly in Vietnam.

3. Both Mao Zedong leader of China communist party Cho and Joseph Stalin leader of the USSR, both given zero F about Ho Chi Minh and his communist party. So the US was the biggest support of Vietnam in 1941-1945. (Griffin Johnson failed to mention this and this is also the biggest misconception and misinformation that the US have about Vietnam thinking that the China and the USSR was always support Vietnam)

4. Griffin Johnson failed to mentioned this, during the Japanese colonism, 2 million Vietnamese people starved to death by the Japanese who stolen all the food in Vietnam for their army.

5. In 1945, after the Japanese left, the French started reinvading Vietnam along with the 20,000 British also wanted a piece of cake to colony Vietnam attacked Vietnam from the South and another 2000 Chinese army (Not the Mao CCP army) also invaded Vietnam from the North. But the Chinese was defeated shortly, the British given up in a year and let the French continue alone. Then the US back stabbed Vietnam, they turned to help the French to recolony Vietnam which later the French lost. (Griffin Johnson failed to mention this information)

6. This part is where Griffin Johnson f0cked up the most, he said Ho chi Minh “It was patriotism, not yet communism....”. If you search from US source it will said “It was patriotism, not communism, that inspired me.”. These are totally biase, and anti-communism propaganda because what Ho Chi Minh said in his quote in full sentence was “It was patriotism, not yet communism, led me confidence in Lenin in the Third International.”. Griffin Johnson and the US based misinformation tried to make it sound it wasn't about communism inspired Ho Chi Minh, but the truth is that it was Ho Chi Minh saying patriotism led him to Vladimir Lenin that inspire him about communism.

To be continue...

​ @Qarmatian Warhorse ...The continue:
7. I preciated that Griffin John pointed the way Ngô Đình Diệm became the president of South Vietnam was not democratic. But he failed to mention that Diệm was installed into became the president of the republic party of South Vietnam by the US government in 1954 and his dictatorship doing of 10 years in power. 

7.1. Before he became the president, Diem has pent years living in US to granted trust and support from American Catholic church leaders as well as conservative and liberal leaders, and politicians. He got attention from the US government, they installed him to power in South Vietnam in hope of establishing a new country witb American-phere influence in South Vietnam like they did to Japan and South Korea.

7.2. During his time 10 years as a president, he arrested 300,000 of people who didn't want to support him, he executed 10,000 people by guillotine who he suspected to be a communist. He oppressed Buddhism, he killed and imprisoned thousands of buddists because he promoted only Christianity and unfavored any none-Christianity religious, so much for freedom of religious. The time of South Vietnam under Diem was horrifically oppressive, and all the Time he was supported by the government and military of the USA.

8. Griffin Johnson fail to mention about the Tonkin accident that started the US invasion of Vietnam that the US government claimed they was being attacked by the North Vietnam is a lie which is very well known and well documented. This is shameful and disappointed. 

8.1. In the 2003 documentary The Fog of War, the former United States Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara admitted that the August 2 USS Maddox attack happened with no Defense Department response, but the August 4 Gulf of Tonkin attack never happened. In 1995, McNamara met with former Vietnam People's Army General Võ Nguyên Giáp to ask what happened on August 4, 1964, in the second Gulf of Tonkin Incident. "Absolutely nothing", Giáp replied.Giáp claimed that the attack had been imaginary.

9. This proven how based Griffin Johnson is using American resources by explaining the Vietcong. Acturally, the communist Vietnamese army never call themselves Vietcong nor used the term Vietcong ever. 

9.1. They was still calling themselves "Việt Minh" since the French war, and sometime calling themselves "Quân giải phóng miền nam Việt Nam" which mean "The Army of liberation front of South Vietnam" or short "Quân giải phóng" which mean "Liberation Army".

9.2. The term Vietcong (Việt Công) was created by Ngô Đình Diệm himself during a interview with a American journalist. Diem wanted to remove all communist movement in the South Vietnam since "Việt Minh" was well known and good repetition across Vietnam for defeated the French, so he came out a new name for "Việt Minh" to make South Vietnamese hate them and view them as evil communists. It is a insult an to Vietnamese soldiers and a propaganda name.

10. The bombing was worst, many Vietnamese people have to stay 24/24 in their village to look out for the US bombing and working together to fill up the hole it's left. There were 7.5 million tons of bombs or a trillion of bombs that was dropped during the war that is 2 time the entire WWII combined which 4.5 million tons landed on Vietnam and rest landed on Laos and Cambodia, killing million of innocent people in all 3 countries. 10% of those bombs did not blowed up when they hit the ground, many of which is buried everywhere in Vietnam and it can claims any innocent life to this day, hundreds of those bombs got discovered every day in Vietnam, and it's estimated will take Vietnam 80 more years since the war ended in 1975 to fully dig them all up. 

11. Griffin Johnson made the Mỹ Lai massacre sounds like was the worst war crime committed by the US army. But infact he failed to mention that there are hundred of massacres worse than that. Mỹ Lai massacre is the only US war crime mentioned in the US school book of Vietnam war, but it is not the only US war crime in Vietnam school book. There are 2 million innocent Vietnamese died in the war, so there are a lot more to cover about the US massacre war crimes. 

11.1. And worst is the use of chemical weapon the Agent Orange used by the US army that effected 5 million Vietnamese and cost 500,000 innocent children born with birth defect got no mentioned by Griffin Johnson. This video shows the evil of agent orange.

12. Giffin Johnson shown the painting of an American soldier who got capture and executed by the Viet Minh. This is horrible but wait, this is actually hilariously and egregiously propaganda distortion. This is used by Griffin Johnson to describe the Viet Minh as the cruel monsters. He combined the pictures of Dewey Wayne Waddell an US pilot who was captured by Viet MInh and the execution of the Việt Minh army captain Nguyễn Văn Lém by a South Vietnamese soldier major Nguyễn Ngọc Loan. WTF Griffin Johnson, why did he combined 2 unrelated pictures to create this propaganda painting? Are he really telling the story from the North Vietnamese perceptive or from the American propaganda dictortion machine?

12.1. The man in the painting is name Dewey Wayne Waddell, a US pilot who was captured by the Viet Minh and latter was released, not only he wasn't being executed, there were no evidence or tail from him being torture by the Viet Minh and he lived until 2017 died at 82. You can search for his name on Google and found the picture that mr.Griffin copied into the painting.

12.2. The part where he got shot in the head by a Viet Minh soldier is the opposite copy of the picture taking of a South Vietnamese soldier major Nguyễn Ngọc Loan executs the Việt Minh army captain Nguyễn Văn Lém who was captured by the South Vietnamese soldiers. You can search for these names on Google and found the original picture. This is a coward act and was shown reversed by Griffin Johnson to tell propaganda lie.

12.3. The US government like to spread fake rumor about the Viet Minh on how they treated the US prisoners but infact There are zero evidence shown a single US prisoner of war was tortured and executed by the Viet Minh. All tails were made up the CIA to discredit the Việt Minh. All US prisoners who released were all in good condition in 1973.

12.4. There is a Viet Minh man name Nguyễn Văn Thương, he was captured by the US army, he was tortured by them, his legs got decapitated piece by piece into 6 pieces by the CIA and he did not open o word to them. I never seen the USA mainstream sources ever mention his name although they can still founded his name from other sources. You can search for him on Google. And that is just one of many examples of how the Viet Minh was tortured by the US and South Vietnam government.

12.5. It is a paradise for the US soldiers in the North Vietnam prison compare to the Viet MInh inside the South Vietnam prison. This video shows how the evil treatments and tortures of the prisoners in South Vietnam:

12.6. Back home the US veterans are treated worse than trashes by the government and the people then they were in the North Vietnam prison.
